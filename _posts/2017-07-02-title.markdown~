#### Hardware
I use nRF52 Development kit (PCA10040). This is connected to the system through USB cable. To flash this development kit, it inbuilt has a Segger JLink Interface.

#### Tools
I used Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. We need Nordic SDK, GNU tools, JLink software and ARM gcc tools. GNU tools are already available in Linux. So this can be avoided. Rest of it we need to download and install.

Download latest <a href="https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF51_SDK/" target="blank">Nordik SDK</a>, the <a href="https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download" target="blank">ARM Tools</a>, the <a href="https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink" target="blank">JLink Tools</a>. Extract Nordic SDK and ARM gcc tools as follows,

{% highlight c++ %} 

unzip ./nRF5_SDK_13.0.0_04a0bfd.zip -d ~/ble
sudo tar -xvfj ./gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_4-2016q3-20160926-linux.tar.bz2 -C /usr/local

{% endhighlight %}

JLink tools will be available as a installer. So you can install JLink software using this installer.
